## RxJS in Angular: Reactive Development
by Deborah Kurata

Angular uses RxJS to create Observable data streams, but thatâ€™s just one of its many features. In this course, you'll learn how to combine streams from multiple data sources, create action streams to react more easily to user actions, and much more.

`APM-WithExtras`: The completed files with some extra code. Use this to see some additional techniques not included in the course.

I've developed a few additional examples, including using action streams to "pass" parameters and retrieve multiple related datasets here: https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-todos-deborahk
